### TODO

[x] Allow scroll to propagate through to cm-scroller - potentially use https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/is-it-possible-to-style-custom-gutter-on-right-side/3776
[] Finish diagnostics integration
[] Clean up selection styling
[x] Selection seems to be off by one line. - only for blocks. not for text
[] Long documents that extend minimap beyond height
[] Bug: jumping width when long line leaves viewport
[] small: add back box shadow when we have h-scroll
[] Bug: overlay not actually showing up now that I extracted it. Probably due to facet - Undefined

Later:

- Git integration?
- Optimize font rendering
